Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code was to learn how to properly code an app, create a calculating function within the code to calcuate a percentage of all the different possible out comes of the various clicking patterns between the cold and allergy questions.
 
Known Issues:
There were many hiccups like missing two </div>'s and having to redo the function for calculating my results multiple times.
